Ep. 160 - Ashlee Vance: Elon Musk and the Quest to Save Mankind
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[He didn’t have permission.
But he did it anyway. And one day Elon Musk called him.
“He was either going to make life really horrible on me or he was going to cooperate with the book” said Ashlee Vance, author of the New York Times bestseller and Wall Street Journal’s “best books of the year,” Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.
Ashlee did 200 interviews before Elon agreed, proving permission is not a starting place.</description>

a16z Podcast: Teams, Trust, and Object Lessons
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[Some of the best management books are actually military books, argues Ben Horowitz. There's just a certain mental toughness and focus that that experience gives you, adds Dick Costolo based on his observations.

So how then do you build trust on a team in a company, when it's not (literally) life or death as it is in the military? When giving someone a public "object lesson" -- the equivalent of Sun Tzu's chopping someone's head off -- could mean losing talent ... or being more tyrant than leader? How do you tell the difference? 

This conversation -- between Horowitz and Costolo (entrepreneur, former CEO of Twitter, comedian and consultant on the HBO show "Silicon Valley") -- took place before a group of 25 veterans who participated in the Breakline education and hiring program (one week of which was hosted at Andreessen Horowitz) for veterans shifting into careers in the tech industry.]]>

a16z Podcast: Investing in (Business and Career) Change
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[Most investors try to invest in things that don't change and last forever -- Warren Buffett for example loves Heinz ketchup! But VC is about investing in things that do change... a lot. How does this basic mindset challenge much of what people learn in business school or classic leadership training?  Do software-led businesses require different mindsets? What are some of the most common things first-time vs. serial entrepreneurs do?

This Q&amp;A -- with Marc Andreessen interviewed by Don Faul (former U.S. Marine platoon commander and head of operations at Google, Facebook, Pinterest, and now COO at Athos) -- covers these topics, as well as what to consider when working for a big- v. small- (and especially intermediate-) -sized company, what it takes to make a career transition, and how to "go back to kindergarten".

The conversation took place before a group of 25 veterans who participated in the Breakline education and hiring program (one week of which was hosted at Andreessen Horowitz) for veterans shifting into careers in the tech industry.]]>

      <itunes:summary>It's not incompetence, but competence, that causes companies to be disrupted. That applies to big companies and small, as well as people too.

Or so argue Clayton Christensen and Marc Andreessen in this podcast, based on a conversation at Startup Grind (moderated by Derek Anderson) between the a16z co-founder and Harvard Business School professor Christensen -- aka the "father of disruption theory" (also known to his wife as "the Jewish mother of business").

This podcast shares everything from their views on managing innovation in companies like Apple, Google, and Twitter (including how to apply the jobs-to-be-done framework there); what the abundance of capital means for innovation; and how to truly measure success and strike work-life balance.</itunes:summary>

<![CDATA[
Bill Gates is one of those people for whom "needs no introduction" is actually true. The polymathic Microsoft founder now leads the world's largest and most important private foundation, and he's predicting that we're on the cusp of the energy breakthrough that's going to save the world. He also talks about the controversial idea that technological innovation is slowing down, assesses how close we are to true artificial intelligence, and explains why you really want to save being sick for 20 years from now.&nbsp;
