			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you've enjoyed my previous <em>in-between episodes</em> , then this might be your favorite episode ever. It's one of the most actionable, information-packed interviews I've ever done.</p>
<p>This time, it's Joel Stein (<a href="https://twitter.com/thejoelstein" target="_blank">@TheJoelStein</a>) asking the questions. Joel is one of the funniest writers I have ever read, and he's great at leading an interview.</p>
<p>Here's how it all happened: Joel wanted me to help him figure out 5 areas he could improve for an upcoming series he was going to create. I have many different conversations with journalists. It can be painful when I have a 1-2 hour conversation, and then it's cut to a single sentence as a quote in a piece. And it's often a misquote. So how do you fix that?</p>
<p>Well, you record it yourself, which is what we did. (With Joel's approval, of course.) This way, you don't "lose" the content, and you cover your ass with media and journalists.</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss a wide variety of topics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How I choose what to improve from infinite options</li>
<li>How you can subtract your way to success</li>
<li>The genius of Ben Franklin</li>
<li>Why self-improvement doesn't mean self-centered</li>
<li>How I say no to time-consuming lunches, coffees, and other meetings</li>
<li>How I tackle <em>cold introductions</em></li>
<li>How I surmounted Lyme Disease</li>
<li>My 100% complete break from start-ups (<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/10/29/startup-vacation-2/" target="_blank">read this for more</a>)</li>
<li>My podcast process</li>
<li>Tools and tactics for reversing email overwhelm</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>I used them to <a href="http://99designs.com/tim" target="_blank">rapid prototype the cover</a> for <em>The 4-Hour Body</em>, and I've also had them help with display advertising and illustrations.

<p><strong>This podcast is also brought to you by</strong><strong> </strong><strong><a href="https://thrivemarket.com/tim">Thrive Market</a>.</strong> If you’re anything like me, you care a lot about the food you put in your body. In fact, I think it’s much more important than exercise. The problem is that <a href="https://thrivemarket.com/tim">good food</a> can be extremely expensive…but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>Thrive Market is like Costco for everything healthy – an online shopping club offering the best brands and groceries at 25-50% off retail prices, shipped nationally for free. There are a lot of <a href="https://thrivemarket.com/ferriss" target="_blank">Slow-Carb Diet friendly items</a> that I recommend in <em>The 4-Hour Body. </em>You can easily filter everything by your preferences: paleo, gluten-free, vegan, raw, non-GMO, etc. Best of all: each paid membership also sponsors a free membership for a low-income family.</p>
<p>Until <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">December 15th</span></span> only, you have an opportunity to <a href="https://thrivemarket.com/ferriss" target="_blank">win $10,000</a> in top-tier healthy food and other prizes from Thrive Market. Go to <a title="" href="https://thrivemarket.com/ferriss" target="_blank">this link</a>, and when you enter to win the prizes, you’ll automatically be sent a link to download the Slow-Carb Diet® Cookbook.</p>
